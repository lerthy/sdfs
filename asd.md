## Component Details

### 1. DNS and Routing Layer
- **Route53 DNS Failover**
  - Primary endpoint: `api.project3.com` → US-EAST-1
  - Standby endpoint: `api-standby.project3.com` → US-WEST-2
  - Health check interval: 30 seconds
  - Failure threshold: 3 consecutive failures
  - Monitored endpoint: `/contact` (HTTPS/443)

### 2. Primary Region (US-EAST-1)
- **API Gateway**
  - Production traffic handling
  - Full capacity deployment
  - HTTPS endpoints with WAF protection
  
- **Lambda Functions**
  - Auto-scaling enabled
  - Production configuration
  - Full monitoring and logging

- **RDS Database (Primary)**
  - Instance Type: Production grade
  - Multi-AZ deployment
  - Automated backups enabled
  - Performance Insights enabled
  - Enhanced monitoring

- **S3 Bucket (Primary)**
  - Version control enabled
  - Cross-region replication configured
  - Origin for CloudFront distribution
  - Encryption at rest

### 3. Standby Region (US-WEST-2)
- **API Gateway**
  - Scaled-down configuration
  - Ready to handle failover traffic
  - Identical API structure to primary

- **Lambda Functions**
  - Minimal cold starts maintained
  - Identical code to primary region
  - Scaled-down concurrency

- **RDS Database (Standby)**
  - Warm standby configuration
  - Read replica from primary
  - Can be promoted to master
  - Scaled-down instance type

- **S3 Bucket (Standby)**
  - Replication target from primary
  - Versioning enabled
  - Ready for failover

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- **CloudWatch Alarms**
  - Database performance metrics
  - API latency monitoring
  - Error rate tracking
  - Resource utilization

- **Health Checks**
  - Endpoint availability monitoring
  - Latency tracking
  - SSL certificate validation
  - Custom health check responses

## Failover Process

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Route53 health checks detect primary region failure
   - Three consecutive failed checks trigger failover
   - CloudWatch alarms activated

2. **DNS Failover**
   - Route53 automatically updates DNS records
   - Traffic redirected to standby region
   - TTL set to 60 seconds for quick propagation

3. **Standby Activation**
   - Standby RDS promoted to master if needed
   - API Gateway capacity increased
   - Lambda concurrency limits adjusted
   - S3 bucket becomes primary

4. **Validation**
   - Health checks confirm standby availability
   - CloudWatch metrics monitored
   - Application logs verified
   - Database replication status confirmed

## Recovery Process

1. **Primary Region Recovery**
   - Verify primary region services
   - Resync data from standby
   - Validate system integrity

2. **Traffic Restoration**
   - Health checks re-enabled for primary
   - DNS failback initiated
   - Monitor traffic migration

3. **Standby Reset**
   - Re-establish replication
   - Scale down standby resources
   - Verify backup configurations

## Testing and Maintenance

### Regular Testing
- Monthly failover drills
- Data consistency validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Recovery time objectives (RTO) validation

### Maintenance Procedures
- Regular updates to both regions
- Capacity planning reviews
- Security patch management
- Configuration synchronization

## Cost Optimization

- Standby region runs at reduced capacity
- Auto-scaling policies for cost control
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Regular cost analysis and optimization

## Security Considerations

- Cross-region IAM policies
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Security group synchronization
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- WAF rules replication

## Documentation and Runbooks

- Failover procedures
- Recovery checklists
- Monitoring guidelines
- Incident response plans
- Contact information for key personnel
